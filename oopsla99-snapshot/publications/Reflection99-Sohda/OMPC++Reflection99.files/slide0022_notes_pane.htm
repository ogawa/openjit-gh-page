  software DSM are the cost of the check at the time of memory access. In this
  system, whenever it accesses, it is checking. Then,<span style="mso-spacerun:

  processing of the access checking is executed per BlockSize. So, we technique
  was applie by hand on memory accesses within the daxpy function, which
  occupies the major portion of calculation in LU kernel. As a result, we
  obtain 5.3 times performance improvement at eight processors.</font><br>
