  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>In OpenJIT, a

  optimization at the time of compile is dynamically read at the time of
  compile. We say this class compilets. The compilets changes processing of
  usual JIT compile and performs the optimization to which it specialized in
  application and runtime environment.</font><br>
