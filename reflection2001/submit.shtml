<p class="t2">SUBMISSION GUIDELINE</p>

<div style="margin-top: 2em">&nbsp;</div>

<h1 id="techpapers">SUBMISSION GUIDELINE</h1>

<p>All submissions, acknowledgements, notifications, etc. will be done electronically. Manuscripts should preferably be prepared <strong>using <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" target="_top">the LNCS format</a> (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)</strong> for submission. Paper length should be <strong>less than 5000 words, excluding figures, tables, and references</strong>.  Papers exceeding this limit will not be reviewed.</p>

<p>The program committee will select papers based on standard scientific grounds and merits such as technical novelty, correctness, technical interest and utility to the community, etc. Case Study/Experience papers will be judged on generality and utility of the feedback provided to the community.</p>

<p>A paper may either be accepted in full form, as a short paper, or recommended as a poster presentation. A short paper will have shorter page allowance in the proceedings. Also, it could be given a shorter presentation slot during the conference.</p>

<p>Papers are solicited on topics including, but not limited to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Systems and applications with a reflective architecture and/or designed with strong separation of concerns</li>

<ul>
  <li>Operating systems/Middleware
  <li>Concurrent /Distributed/Parallel/Mobile systems

</ul>

<li>Software Engineering

<ul>
  <li>Metaobject protocols
  <li>Programming methodologies and environments
  <li>Metamodels (UML, CORBA, etc.)

  <li>Language and environment support
  <li>Specification, verification and analysis of concerns and their compositions

<h1 id="submit">SUBMISSION PROCEDURE</h1>

<p>To allow smooth processing of the review, we strongly encourage you to submit the paper in two phases (although not a strict requirement).</p>

<p>In the first phase, the abstract of the paper written in English will be electronically submitted before (and including) <strong>March 9<sup>th</sup>, 2001</strong> at <a href="http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/reflection2001/submit/" target="_top">http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/reflection2001/submit/</a>. This will allow us to process the submission smoothly for early reviewer assignments. Submission will be possible starting January 25th, 2001.</p>

<p>In the second phase, the full paper must be electronically submitted before (and including) <strong>March 15<sup>th</sup>, 2001</strong>. The paper must be written in English and not longer then 5,000 words. Papers arriving late or clearly longer than the limit may be rejected immediately, without being reviewed. Submission of papers whose abstract had not been submitted by March 9th is allowed, but the abstract and other submission information must accompany the submission.</p>
