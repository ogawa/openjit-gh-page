<h2>Dynamic Adaptation: Lessons Learned from Microkernel to Smart Space Computing</h2>

<p><b>Hideyuki Tokuda, <em>Dean of Graduate School of Media and Governance and Professor, Faculty of Environmental Information, Keio University</em></b></p>

<p>In this talk, we will discuss dynamic adaptation of programmed systems based on our software development efforts ranging from the RT-Mach microkernel to the Smart Space Computing Environment.</p>

<p>We have been working on the development of RT-Mach microkernel for embedded real-time systems and distributed multimedia systems for over several years.  One of the challenging issues was to create dynamic adaptation mechanisms for supporting various types of run-time environment and application software.  We have classified these mechanisms in to three categories based on the micorkernel architecture, namely SS (Service by Server), SL (Service by Library), and SK (Service by Kernel Module).  We first look back these mechanisms based on our practical examples such as a UNIX server, Environmental server, scheduling policy module, and real-time threads.</p>

<p>We then talk about new challenges in creating dynamic adaptation mechanisms for smart space computing environment. In our smart space computing environment, a user should be able to continue the execution of his/her task despite of environmental changes, such as different processor, display, network, location, time zone, and so on. System and application software should be adaptable to such user's environmental changes as well as user's needs. We support context-aware and adaptable software together with dynamic service finding, binding, and re-binding mechanisms. A few examples of adaptable software such as VNA(Virtual Networked Appliances) and WN(Wearable Networks) will be demonstrated.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we summarize the lessons learned from the development of dynamic adaptable software.</p>
