<h1 id="objectives">OBJECTIVES</h1>

<p>Metalevel architectures and reflection have attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners throughout computer science. Reflective and metalevel techniques are being used to address real-world problems in such areas as: programming languages, operating systems, databases, distributed computing, expert systems and web computing.</p>

<p>Reflection and related technologies like, AOP and SOP, have proven to be powerful tools for improving the separation of concerns in complex systems.  Systems built using these technologies can have better modularity than systems built using object-oriented or procedural programming alone.</p>

<p>Separation of concerns has been a guiding principle of software engineering for nearly 30 years, but it's known benefits are seldom fully achieved in practice. This is primarily because traditional mechanisms for separating concerns into modules and then composing those modules into systems are not powerful enough to handle the many kinds of concerns that occur in practice. Over the last 10 years, this problem has attracted the attention of many researchers, including several from the reflection community, who have proposed approaches, including uses of reflection, to overcoming these limitations. For the first time, papers on advanced approaches to separation of concerns are explicitly solicited, so that this conference will also provide an opportunity for researchers in this growing area to discuss recent developments.</p>

<p>Following the success of two previous conferences, Reflection'96 in San Francisco (online proceedings available at <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/" target="_top">http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/groups/projects/reflection96/</a>), and Reflection'99 in Saint Malo (proceedings available as Springer LNCS 1616), this conference will provide an opportunity for researchers with a broad range of interests in metalevel architectures, reflective techniques, and separation of concerns in general.</p>

<h1 id="papers">PAPER SUBMISSION</h1>

<p>All submissions, acknowledgements, notifications, etc. will be done electronically. Manuscripts should preferably be prepared using <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" target="_top">the LNCS format</a> (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) for submission. Paper length should be less than 5000 words, excluding figures, tables, and references.  Papers exceeding this limit will not be reviewed.</p>

<p>The program committee will select papers based on standard scientific grounds and merits such as technical novelty, correctness, technical interest and utility to the community, etc. Case Study/Experience papers will be judged on generality and utility of the feedback provided to the community.</p>

<p>A paper may either be accepted in full form, as a short paper, or recommended as a poster presentation. A short paper will have shorter page allowance in the proceedings. Also, it could be given a shorter presentation slot during the conference.</p>

<p>The submission guideline and procedure are detailed at <a href="submit.shtml">http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/reflection2001/submit.html</a>.</p>

<!--p>The conference website will detail the exact submission procedure by late January.</p-->


<h1 id="posters">POSTERS</h1>

<!--p>Posters will be separately solicited for a poster presentation slot in the conference. Additionally, as stated above, a submitted paper may be recommended for acceptance as a poster presentation. Each poster will have a page abstract in the proceedings if publication deadline permits.</p-->
