<h1 id="scope">Technical Scope</h1>

<p>Reflection and related techniques are now widely accepted as ways of 
improving the separation of concerns in complex systems. Reflection 
has been applied to the design and implementation of many different 
kinds of system, including operating systems, programming languages, 
and middleware. The clear separation of concerns achieved by using 
reflection is believed to result in systems that are easier to 
design, implement and validate.</p>

<p>The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners
working on reflective systems to reflect on their practical experiences of the
use of reflection and to discuss whether it lives up to its promise.  The
workshop will be limited in size to a maximum of 50 participants to enhance
discussion, with participants invited on the basis of position papers.</p>

<h1 id="topics">Topics of Interest</h1>

<ul>
<li> The design and implementation of reflective systems;
<li> Experiences with reflective systems in suitable application domains, e.g.
     mobile computing;
<li> Experience with quasi-reflective systems such as CORBA interceptors or
     the Meta-Object Facility;
<li> Consideration of alternative techniques for dynamic configuration
     and/or re-configuration;
<li> Examination of potentially complementary techniques such as
     aspect-oriented programming;
<li> Techniques to improve performance and/or scalability of reflective
     systems;
<li> Approaches to maintain the integrity of reflective technologies;
<li> Experiences with validation of reflective systems;
<li> Tool support for reflective systems;
<li> Experiences with the implementation of non-functional requirements such as
     quality of service, security, and so on.
</ul>

<p>The workshop will take place on the 25th of September. The format of
the workshop will combine presentations on submitted position papers,
invited presentations and a discussion session. There will be the
following invited presentations:</p>

<ul>
<li> Geoff Coulson (University of Lancaster) will speak about experience in developing of OpenORB;
<li> Ian Welch (University of Newcastle upon Tyne) will speak about security and reflection;
<li> Jacques Noy&eacute or Mario Sudh&#246lt (&#201cole des Mines de Nantes) will speak about Reflection for Adaptable Mobility.
</ul>

<h1 id="submission">Submission Procedure</h1>

<p>Position papers of not more than 5 pages in Postscript or PDF format should
be sent to</p>

<p><a href="mailto: reflection2001-workshop@is.titech.ac.jp">reflection2001-workshop@is.titech.ac.jp</a></p>

<p>by the 25th of August. A technical programme will then be put together by the organizers, based on the submitted position papers, with emphasis being given to papers that provide an opportunity for discussion. The notification deadline for acceptance of a paper for the workshop is August 31st. The set of 
accepted position papers will be made available on the workshop's website (<a href="/reflection2001/reflective-systems.html">http://www.openjit.org/reflection2001/reflective-systems.html</a>) in advance of the workshop so as to facilitate discussion.</p>
