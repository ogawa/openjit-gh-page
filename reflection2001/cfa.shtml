<h1 id="how-to-reach">HOW TO REACH KYOTO</h1>

<p>Kyoto is almost at a middle of Japan islands.  The best way to reach there is to arrive at Kansai International Airport (KIX) in Osaka and take a train to Kyoto (80min).  Another option is to arrive at Osaka International Airport "Itami" (ITM) and take a shuttle bus to Kyoto (50min) although it should be difficult to find an airplane directly arriving at Itami.  If you want to visit Tokyo as well, you can first arrive at New Tokyo International Airport "Narita" (NRT) and take a bullet train "Shinkansen" to Kyoto (2.5 hours).  No matter which airport you arrive at, I strongly recommend using public transportation; <strong>please don't rent a car or enjoy a drive in Japan.</strong> It is a really dangerous idea unless you have a great experience of driving a car in Japan.</p>

<p>Another tip you may want to know is that another Tokyo International Airport "Haneda" (HND) is far from "Narita" (NRT). Although they are directly connected by train and shuttle bus, it takes two or more hours.  If you stay in Tokyo, flying from "Handea" to "Itami" (1 hour) is not a bad idea.  Both airports are close to the city centers and there are shuttles between them.</p>

<p>Taking taxis within Kyoto as well as in other cities such as Tokyo is a convenient method of transportation, and the fare is also reasonable. All taxis are metered and you do not have to tip the taxi driver or pay for luggage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we strongly advise against taking a taxi to/from Narita airport, unless there are more than 2 people sharing the ride. Since it is located more than 60kms away from Tokyo, and the expensive toll road prices, a taxi ride between the airport and Tokyo could cost as much as 20,000 yens (180 Euros, or $160 U.S.).</p>

<h2>From Kansai International Airport (KIX):</h2>

<p>80 minutes by JR Airport Express "Haruka" (train) to Kyoto station.</p>

<h2>From New Tokyo Internatioal Airport (NRT):</h2>

<p>1 hour by JR Narita Express (train), or 2 hours(?) by Airport limousine bus, to Tokyo Station.</p>

<p>2.5 hours by JR Shinkansen "Nozomi" or "Hikari" (train) from Tokyo to Kyoto.</p>

<p>There should be a discount train ticket only for foreign tourists. Please contact your local travel agency.</p>

<h2>From Kyoto to the conference site:</h2>

<p>The conference site is <a href="http://www.krp.co.jp/HP98Ehtml/">Kyoto Research Park</a> (KRP). To reach there, you must take a JR San'in Honsen (or JR Sagano line) from Kyoto Station to Tanbaguchi Station (5 min).  KRP is 5min walk from Tanbaguchi.  If you take a taxi, it will take 10min (1,000 to 2,000 japanese yen).  The conference hotels are located near Kyoto Station.</p>
