<p>The OpenJIT project is an ongoing Java&#153; the programming language JIT compiler project as a collaborative effort between Tokyo Institute of Technology and Fujitsu Laboratory, partly sponsored by the Information Promotion Agency of Japan. OpenJIT is a "reflective" JIT compiler in that not only it is almost entirely written in Java, but also that it bootstraps and compiles itself during execution of the user program, and compiler components coexist as first-class objects in user heap space. Thus, users can tailor and customize the compilation of classes at runtime for variety of purposes such as application-specific optimization and partial evaluation, dynamic, compiler-assisted environment adaptation of programs, debugging, language extension and experimentation, and other types of advanced compiler-based research and applications. OpenJIT even allows full dynamic update of itself by loading the compiler classes on the fly from the network. OpenJIT is fully JDK compliant, and plugs into standard JVMs several Unix platforms such as Solaris (Sparc), Linux (x86), and FreeBSD (x86). On Linux/x86 platform, OpenJIT 1.1.14 (the current release) is faster than the JDK 1.2 classic VM compiler, runs more or less the same speed as other commercial JIT compilers on classic VM. We are releasing the project Web page <!--snapshot CD--> which includes the release version of the backend (version 1.1.14), partially completed frontend, various papers and presentation, and documents. OpenJIT is completely free so long as it is used for non-commercial purposes. Its source, binaries, etc. can be freely distributed and modified without restriction. Information on OpenJIT can be found on <a target="_top" href="http://www.openjit.org/">www.openjit.org</a>, that is, on this website.</p>
